ABSTRACT
Today's society needs technology. There is a need to have a smart home that 
can turn a smart device on or off via a smartphone. Earlier we used to press the 
switch or remote button to turn the device on or off. To design smart home in 
cisco Packet Tracer using IoT where we can test system, check Network 
configuration. Through smartphones we can test various IoT devices that can 
be controlled and monitored.
IOE devices are connected to internet to allow the distant monitoring and 
controlling of different home appliances such as lighting, heating, cooling, and 
alarming.
CISCO PACKET TRACER simulation software is used to implement smart 
home. The features include different sensor, actuator and different smart devices 
which is used for home automation.

This home is the variation of the first home. This home can be remotely controlled by the 3G network 
Smartphone. The IOT intelligence is remotely provided by the remote provider as a service.
In the above architecture of smart home all the devices are connected to Home Gateway wirelessly and 
wired medium. The backend logic was provided by the remote connection to cloud server hosted by a third 
party. The user has ability to connect to IOT control page using a Smartphone remotely via a 5G network
# The network layout in this smart home is as follows
